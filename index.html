            <p> Hobbies are a great way to relax and unwind. These are done after a stressful day at school, college, or office. There is no rule of what can be termed as a hobby. And my hobby is photography. Photography has always been one of my favorite hobbies. When I take pictures, it's like seeing things in a new perspective.</p>
